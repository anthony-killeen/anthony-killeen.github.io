git this git that <br>
add this add that <br>
commit this <br>
push that <br>
commit this jargon to memory <br>
console.log(All + This + Lingo) <br>
Wait. Do I need quotes on those? <br>
too late no time to stall <br>
keep going <br>
git this git that <br>
push this pitter <br>
stage that patter <br>
<br>
i find my mind <br> 
wanting to pushBack <br>
wanting to .gitignore it all <br> 
<br>
i know <br>
i'll git clone myself to get all this shit learned <br>
three new languages in as many weeks <br>
im having a variable time of this <br>
an array of feelings floating <br>
through the border of my skull <br>
quick someone fork a back up branch of my mind <br>
merge it back later <br>
when this is all over <br>
<br>
waking up at 5am with mangled code on my mind <br>
my mind's eye seeing like Neo <br>
except none of it makes anySenseWhatsoever <br>
stray curly brackets bounce around <br>
the insides of these nested neurons <br>
Neo if he's hit his head { <br>
	return barelyFunctioning <br>
}<br>
<br>
git this git that <br>
im barely functioning but also <br> 
im operating at full function <br>
i am keeping up <br>
just about <br>
ive never been functioning more highly <br>
<span style="color:green">< !--  maybe thats 'cause the clock just struck 420 --></span></p> 
but no <br>
dont do that <br>
you div <br>
you need to < /div> <br>
you need all the memory you can get <br>
wait til after <br>
once its all done <br>
once the baseline knowledge is staged and committed <br>
then it can be time to shine <br>
time to flow <br>
in that sweet warm glow <br>
 at 416 + 4 <br>
