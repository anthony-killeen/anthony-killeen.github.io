<ol type="1" class="questions">
  <li><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong></li>
    <p>My long term career goals are creative. I’m currently on the fourth draft of a 500page novel, something I’ve been working hard on for the last four years. And I’ve also been performing stand-up comedy for some years, something I want to make a dedicated go at once the novel is finished. Web development will be a way to support these main goals. It will upgrade my day job to something more stimulating, better pay, and enable remote work. And who knows maybe I’ll bring to life some of those app ideas I’ve had over the years. 
    </p>
  <li><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</strong></li>
  <p>Strengths are enthusiasm, idea generation, and I’m a quick learner, as long as I’m organised with it. Which leads me onto my. . . <br>
    Limitations: My enthusiasm likes to jump to new shiny avenues if things get a little stale. I get bored. And I’m naturally unorganised. Unless I get on top of it all by really applying myself. I know what must be done. Instilling a solid routine and making a consistent commitment to removing distractions. 
  </p>
  <li><strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></li>
  <p>To be patient and persevere if I’m not naturally good or quick at picking something up.
    Not to compare myself to others' development. 
    </p>
  <li><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </strong></li>
  <p>I will stay focussed on this one course and not get pulled in other directions, any other activities I do will facilitate and support the priority: this course. Things to keep my mind and body healthy, making sure I’m getting enough exercise, getting out on walks, meditating. WIth regards to working with others, I’m naturally a supportive and collaborative person.
 <br> This happened already this week. I had to be mindful of the urges to run away from the feelings of frustration and stress. I had to back up, zoom out a bit, and come back to it and stay consistent with small work sessions (just one or two pomodoros) before taking a slightly longer break of 15-20 minutes, before returning. I had to work on not being self-critical and dispel self-doubt. Getting out in nature helps. 
  </p>
  <li><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. </strong></li>
  <p>I will seek help when I need it, before it’s too late, either from other students in my cohort on Discord/messenger etc., or facilitators. I think I do have a tendency to struggle by myself in isolation, especially if the medium to get help is public (i.e. the main Discord channels). I think this will resolve once I meet people in person but I will work on it before then. 
  </p>
  <li><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team. </strong></li>
  <p>To facilitate our learning, mentors to help us get around blocks either technically or on the core skills side. 
  </p>
  <li><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong></li>
  <p>    I honestly won’t be able to afford to do much with living in Wellington on student allowance. I’m keeping a mostly free calendar, aside from scheduling time to exercise.
