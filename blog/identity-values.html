<ol type="1" class="questions">
  <li><strong>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong></li>
    <p>I bought a pair of All Birds shoes! I'm ethical! But seriously (I actually have two pairs, <em>double ethics</em>) Nah nah but seriously, I suppose a recent ethical decision was when earlier this year I found out a good friend was going through a real bad time mentally, so I moved cities to live with him for a few months to try help him through it. I had to weigh it up against other options, but luckily I was in a flexible situation that allowed me to move at the drop of a hat, and it felt like the right thing to do. 
    </p>
  <li><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong></li>
    <p>Due to max openness stats I'm easily influenced. Depending on culture. Depending on people around me. This makes it super important for me to be intentional about who I spend time with, and what I spend my time on in general, what I consume online, how many hobbies I'm picking up. It's obviously best to surround ourselves with similar motivated, inspiring and supportive people to feed off each other.  </p>
